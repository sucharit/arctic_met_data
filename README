You already need to have Python installed. 

First save the programs main_met_data.py and extract_met_data.py in the same directory as the .MET files.

Modify the extract_met_data.py to suit your own needs.

Then run python extract_met_data.py

For instance, on a Bash terminal in a Linux system, just cd to the relevant directory, and type
python extract_met_data.py

(With the given examples, this will output some data from Aug-11 to Aug-13 to the screen, and create a huge csv file with per-minute data from Aug-11 to Oct-11.)
